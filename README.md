### Unsupervised Machine Learning: Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques
  #### About the Project
This project applies clustering techniques to segment customers based on their attributes, leveraging the Mall_Customers dataset. The segmentation provides actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer relationship management.

  Dataset
The dataset is used to identify customer segments based on their income and spending behavior and  contains information about 200 customers, including:

1. Customer ID
2. Gender
3. Age
4. Annual Income
5. Spending Score


        Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to:
1. Segment customers into distinct groups using clustering techniques.
2. Analyze and visualize the results to derive meaningful business insights.
         Techniques and Methods
1. Clustering Algorithms
2. K-Means Clustering
3. Hierarchical Clustering
          Optimization Techniques
- Elbow Curve: To determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.
- Silhouette Score: To validate cluster quality.
- Dendrogram Threshold: To identify clusters in Hierarchical Clustering.
          Feature Scaling
- StandardScaler: Used for K-Means Clustering to standardize features.
- MinMaxScaler: Used for Hierarchical Clustering to normalize features.
          Visualizations
This is used to effectively interpret the clustering outcomes:
- Bar Charts and Pie Charts: To explore dataset distributions.
- Scatter Plots: To visualize clusters.
- Treemaps: To represent cluster proportions.
        Results
Customers were successfully segmented into distinct groups based on their income and spending scores and the clustering outcomes provide insights for personalized marketing strategies:
- Budget-conscious customers: Offer low-cost products.
- Affluent customers: Market premium products.
- Middle-income customers: Focus on mid-range offerings.
