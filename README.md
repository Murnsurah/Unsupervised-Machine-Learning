Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques
About the Project
This project applies clustering techniques to segment customers based on their attributes, leveraging the Mall_Customers dataset. The segmentation provides actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer relationship management.

Dataset
The Mall_Customers dataset contains information about 200 customers, including:

Customer ID
Gender
Age
Annual Income
Spending Score
The dataset is used to identify customer segments based on their income and spending behavior.

Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to:

Segment customers into distinct groups using clustering techniques.
Analyze and visualize the results to derive meaningful business insights.
Techniques and Methods
Clustering Algorithms
K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Optimization Techniques
Elbow Curve: To determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.
Silhouette Score: To validate cluster quality.
Dendrogram Threshold: To identify clusters in Hierarchical Clustering.
Feature Scaling
StandardScaler: For K-Means Clustering to standardize features.
MinMaxScaler: For Hierarchical Clustering to normalize features.
Visualizations
To effectively interpret the clustering outcomes:

Bar Charts and Pie Charts: To explore dataset distributions.
Scatter Plots: To visualize clusters.
Treemaps: To represent cluster proportions.
Results
Customers were successfully segmented into distinct groups based on their income and spending scores.
The clustering outcomes provide insights for personalized marketing strategies:
Budget-conscious customers: Offer low-cost products.
Affluent customers: Market premium products.
Middle-income customers: Focus on mid-range offerings.
